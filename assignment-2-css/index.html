                    <p>[Verse 1]</p>
                    <p>Tap the <span>rhythm</span> against the <span>floor</span></p>
                    <p>To look for another <span>door</span></p>
                    <p>I am slipping into the <span>mystery</span> of the night</p>
                    <p>I know there is an easier way</p>
                    <p>But it is my choice anyway</p>
                    <p>Don't let me <span class="font-1">waste</span> <span>my</span> <span>time</span> in futile thinking anymore</p>

                    <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>

                    <p><span class="font-1">Watch me,</span> I never will lean upon you</p>
                    <p>I can go <span>by myself</span></p>
