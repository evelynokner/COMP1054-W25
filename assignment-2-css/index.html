                <h1>Fly in the Freedom</h1>
                <p>
                    [Verse 1]
                    Tap the <span>rhythm</span> against the <span>floor</span>
                    To look for another <span>door</span>
                    I am slipping into the <span>mystery</span> of the night
                    I know there is an easier way
                    But it is my choice anyway
                    Don't let me <span>waste</span> <span>my</span> <span>time</span> in futile thinking anymore

                    [Pre-Chorus]
                    <span class="">Fated</span> not to be tamed
                    <span>Watch me,</span> I never will lean upon you
                    I can go <span>by myself</span> <!-- choppy beat -->

                    [Chorus]
                    <span>(Fly in the freedom!)</span> Time never stop and wait for me
                    (Show the way!) Looking for answers and looking for the clue

                    [Post-Chorus]
                    Fly in the <span>freedom!</span>
                    Oh, yeah, oh!
                    
                    [Verse 2]
                    Nobody taught me to <span>hint</span>
                    Win a happy life of a <span>dream</span>
                    I'm not waiting for a <span>fortune teller</span>
                    I feel that my wish will come true
                    I've never thought ahead to that luck
                    Is it my <span>treasure?</span> <span>Tell</span> <span>me</span> what I've really looked for

                    [Pre-Chorus]
                    <span>Fancy</span> came to my mind
                    <span>It leads me</span> to somewhere far away
                    Distant place, <span>distant time</span> <!-- rising note (wavy/italic), higher note to lower note -->

                    [Chorus]
                    <span>(Fly in the freedom!)</span> Time never stop and wait for me
                    (Show the way!) Looking for answers and looking for the clue
                    <span>(Fly in the freedom!)</span> There is a lot of things to do
                    Come on, I'm ready to gamble, it's time to play the game
                    <span>(Fly in the freedom!)</span> Tell me what is this feeling?
                    (Show the way!) I'm in a <span>paradise</span>, I'll keep it forever
                    <span>(Fly in the freedom!)</span> I'll never stop my steps
                    I believe in myself, I know that I can
                    Sure I know!

                    [Chorus]
                    <span>(Fly in the freedom!)</span> Time never stop and wait for me
                    (Show the way!) Looking for answers, and looking for the clue
                    <span>(Fly in the freedom!)</span> There is a lot of things to see
                    Come on, I'm ready to gamble, it's time to play the game
                    <span>(Fly in the freedom!)</span> Tell me what is this feeling
                    (Show the way!) I'm in a <span>paradise</span>, I'll keep it forever
                    <span>(Fly in the freedom!)</span> Dreams are always around me
                    Oh, it comes to my hands, it's really clear to me
                    Sure I know!

                    [Outro]
                    Looking for answers, and looking for the clue
                    I'm in a <span>paradise</span>, I'll keep it forever
                    Looking for answers, and looking for the clue
                    I'm in a <span>paradise</span>, I'll keep it forever
